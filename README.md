Write a while loop that counts down from 60 seconds and

NASA's countdown to launch includes checkpoints where NASA engineers complete certain technical tasks. During the final minute, NASA has 6 tasks to complete:

<ul>
  <li>Orbiter transfers from ground to internal power (T-50 seconds)</li>
  <li>Ground launch sequencer is go for auto sequence start (T-31 seconds)</li>
  <li>Activate launch pad sound suppression system (T-16 seconds)</li>

  <li>Main engine start (T-6 seconds)</li>
  <li>Solid rocket booster ignition and liftoff! (T-0 seconds)</li>
  </ul>
NOTE: "T-50 seconds" read as "T-minus 50 seconds".</br>
Directions:</br>
Write a while loop that counts down from 60 seconds and:
</br>
If there's a task being completed, it prints out the task</br>
If there is no task being completed, it prints out the time as T-x seconds</br>
Use the task and time descriptions described above.</br>
